### Description

The design must retain the formal elements of a poster, communicate using the traditional rhetoric of a poster, and must scale to fit the portrait format (1080x1920). The choice of movement should feel natural and not distract from the content of the poster. The movement should emphasize the message of the poster not confuse the message. The Artivive app will be used to allow for an AR experience with the final printed poster.

* Information for the event is clearly displayed
* Portrait format at 1080x1920
* Loops seamlessly
* Printed version at 15" 26 1/3"
* AR using Artivive

### Checkpoints

* February 10: First still draft of poster
* February 17: First draft of posters in motion
* February 24: Almost final draft of posters in motion
