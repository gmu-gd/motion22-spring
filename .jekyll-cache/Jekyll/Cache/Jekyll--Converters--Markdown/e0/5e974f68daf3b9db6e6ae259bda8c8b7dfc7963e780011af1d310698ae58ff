<h3 id="delivery-and-timing">Delivery and Timing</h3>

<p>We will meet once a week in person on Thursday from 10:30 to 1:10 in room 1023 in the Art and Design Building. The classes are required and during our sessions we will discuss work, complete workshops, and further our design knowledge. The class is scheduled to run for 15 weeks plus a final critique day and you can expect to work for 6 hours outside of class each week.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>AVT 217: Intro to Web Design and AVT 311: Graphic Design Principles and Methods</p>

<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>Motion Design introduces the theories, techniques and practices of motion design and the integration of design, image, sound, video, and animation.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>This is not a software training course. Although there will be occasional in-class software demos a majority of the software skills will need to be self taught. Through the exercises, in-class workshops, projects, and critiques the students will learn the fundamental principles of time-based design grounded in traditional design principles.</p>

<p>Participants should finish the course with a working knowledge of motion design principles and methods as well as a better understanding of the production side of the medium.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To improve general design skills</li>
  <li>To have an understanding of storyboarding</li>
  <li>To understand the technical aspects of motion design</li>
  <li>To analyze how motion can enhance a narrative</li>
  <li>To understand how static design principles apply to a motion-based medium</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>
<p>There is no textbook for this course.</p>

<h3 id="programs">Programs</h3>

<h4 id="design">design</h4>
<p>You must have After Effects to participate in this course. We will also use Photoshop and Illustrator to produce assets and other files throughout the semester. See Technology Requirements for more information.</p>

<h4 id="other">other</h4>
<p>Zoom (joining class sessions if necessary), Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or some other internet browser (accessing class website and uploading videos), and a Vimeo account.</p>

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>This course consists of many shorter exercises, a few longer projects, quizzes, and in class discussions. The exercises are to begin to familiarize students with specific concepts and ideas and the projects are a synthesis of the concepts and ideas we will cover. Quizzes will review information from the lessons and discussions will be used for critiques and analysis of relevant topics.</p>

<h4 id="project-1-a-simple-sequence">project 1: a simple sequence</h4>
<p>Concepts of time start to get fuzzy when dealing with individual frames. A 10 second video at 30 frames a second needs 300 frames to fill that time. This project will focus on the importance of designing for motion without actually animating anything. Students will create storyboards, reference boards, and concept boards for a short sequence. The sequence will not be animated. <a href="/projects">More information here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="project-2-obstructions">project 2: obstructions</h4>
<p>Obstructions in design can seem like a burden but being able to use them as a creative starting point is key. Students will create a short video and then create the same video three more times. Each new video will be created using a series of obstructions chosen in class. <a href="/projects">More information here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="project-3-various">project 3: [various]</h4>
<p>Project three will give you the option of coming up with your own project or choosing from one of the projects I have listed. The project will be a culmination of the skills and concepts you have learned throughout this course. <a href="/projects">More information here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="engagement">Engagement</h3>
<p>This course has an engagement policy instead of an attendance policy. Your engagement will affect your final grade (and, by extension, the quality of your work) for this course. You are expected to actively and passionately take part in this course in the following ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attend class meetings</li>
  <li>Create things and be prepared to show them on time.</li>
  <li>Make things thoughtfully, intentionally, and with intensity.</li>
  <li>Meet all deadlines for handing in work and process.</li>
  <li>Actively participate in critiques both in class and out of class.</li>
  <li>Be curious about making things and the things your classmates make.</li>
  <li>Care about yourself &amp; your work, your classmates &amp; their work, and this class.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Grades will be based on engagement (25%),  exercises (25%), and projects (50%).</p>

<h4 id="engagement-25">engagement (25%)</h4>
<p>This percentage will be based on your engagement in the class which is explained on previous page but will include attendance, discussion and readings, critiques, and overall participation. Be engaged in this course and its content throughout the semester and this should be an easy 25%.</p>

<h4 id="exercises-25">exercises (25%)</h4>
<p>The exercises are graded using a basic rubric show in the PDF version of the syllabus. The rubric includes your ability to follow the instructions of the exercise and your ability to submit it on time. The exercises are meant to be quicker, skill building tasks that improve your projects and design knowledge.</p>

<h4 id="projects--50">projects  (50%)</h4>
<p>Each project will generate two different grades. One grade will be based on your ability to submit the required, weekly checkpoints for the project. These weekly checkpoints use a simple rubric based on your effort, timeliness, improvement, and completion. The second grade will be based on the final project you submit and has a more extensive rubric. At the end of the semester you will have 6 total project grades that are all weighted equally for this 50%. The rubrics used for grading the checkpoints and projects are in the PDF syllabus.</p>

<h4 id="rubrics">rubrics</h4>
<p>Rubrics are used to grade exercises, projects, and checkpoints. The rubrics are available in the PDF syllabus.</p>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>Your ability to communicate with me is of prime importance in this course. If you are going to be absent, late, or not have your work, it will be your best interest in  communicating those things to me in advance. I do not need to know your reasons for being absent, late, or not having your work but I do need to know. A simple, short email will be fine.</p>

<p>The same goes for if you are struggling in this class or having other issues that are hindering your ability to complete work in this class. The more you keep me in the loop the more I can help you and adjust as needed.</p>

<h3 id="weekly-schedule">Weekly Schedule</h3>
<p>Class is on Thursdays from 1:30‚Äì4:10. Most days we will meet for the entire time but some weeks we will have individual meetings or end early. Unless otherwise specified, all work is due at the beginning of class.</p>

<p>A note‚ÄîTime management is an important skill to master and should be worked on all your classes. Staying up all night working is not a badge of honor, it typically means you didn‚Äôt budget your time correctly. Staying up all night isn‚Äôt healthy and, especially now, making sure you are keeping yourself healthy is your first priority.</p>

<p>A second note‚ÄîRendering doesn‚Äôt happen in five minutes (most of the time). In order to be prepared for class you will most likely need to render things prior to showing up in class. After Effects allows work to be previewed but can be laggy and difficult in certain situations. All work we are reviewing should be rendered as a video file outside of After Effects.</p>

<h3 id="semester-schedule">Semester Schedule</h3>
<p>The <a href="/schedule/">schedule</a> on this site is an outline of what we will be covering this spring. It is subject to additions and subtractions.</p>

<h3 id="discussion-of-work">Discussion of Work</h3>
<p>You will need to take an active role in both the presentation and discussion of your work. We will review projects in a variety of ways and you are expected to be able to talk and write about your own work and give feedback to your peers about their work. The ability to discuss your work and other student‚Äôs work is a very important part of your education at Mason. Use this class to improve on those skills.</p>

<h3 id="visual-voices-lecture-series">Visual Voices Lecture Series</h3>

<p>Students are expected to attend the class periods of the courses for which they register. In-class (including sections that meet online) participation is important not only to the individual student, but also to the class as a whole. Because class participation may be a factor in grading, instructors may use absence, tardiness, or early departure as de facto evidence of nonparticipation. Students who miss an exam with an acceptable excuse may be penalized according to the individual instructor‚Äôs grading policy, as stated in the course syllabus.</p>

<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h3>
<p>To promote a stronger sense of mutual responsibility, respect, trust, and fairness among all members of the George Mason University Community and with the desire for greater academic and personal achievement, we, the student members of the university community, have set forth this Honor Code: Student Members of the George Mason University community pledge not to cheat, plagiarize, steal, or lie in matters related to academic work. <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">Honor Code</a></p>

<h3 id="statement-on-ethics-in-teaching-and-practicing-art-and-design">Statement on Ethics in Teaching and Practicing Art and Design</h3>
<p>As professionals responsible for the education of undergraduate and graduate art and design students, the faculty of the School of Art adheres to the ethical standards and practices incorporated in the professional Code of Ethics of our national accreditation organization, The National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD).</p>

<h3 id="anti-racism-statement">Anti-racism Statement</h3>
<p>I explicitly reject white supremacy and racism and am committed to equity, justice, and democracy in society, on campus, and within my classrooms. No matter the name or label, anti-Black and anti-Semitic, and racist thought and action are antithetical to my mission and values as an educator. I condemn the divisive and intimidating tactics of white supremacist views.</p>

<p>I recognize that systemic racism is pervasive within our society and institutions, and pledge to combat it through receiving critical feedback on how I can be more inclusive and being more self-aware of my privileged identities. Including the use of collective teaching, programming, scholarship, and service. I want you, Mason‚Äôs students, to know that I am committed to fostering a classroom where everyone can learn without the chilling effects of bigoted views.</p>

<p>I am determined to uphold the University‚Äôs mission, which states that, ‚ÄúWe hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards as educators, scholars, and professionals,‚Äù and thus am committed to creating a culture of excellence, inclusion, and accessibility.</p>

<p>I welcome all members of our extended community regardless of their race, ethnicity, immigration status, religion, sexual identity, gender identity, socioeconomic status, political or institutional affiliation, and ability, and am fully dedicated to promoting a diversity of voices and views as an academic department.</p>

<p>I recognize that there is still much self- and systemic-work to be done to make the spaces of the University safe and hospitable to all and am committed to continuing to do that work. My door is open to any students seeking support or guidance.</p>

<h3 id="land-acknowledgment">Land Acknowledgment</h3>

<h3 id="official-communications-via-mason-e-mail">Official Communications via Mason e-mail</h3>
<p>Students are responsible for the content of university communications sent to their George Mason University e-mail account and are required to activate their account and check it regularly. All communication from the university, college, school, and program will be sent to students solely through their Mason e-mail account.</p>

<h3 id="important-deadlines">Important Deadlines:</h3>
<p>Once the add and drop deadlines have passed, instructors do not have the authority to approve requests from students to add or drop/withdraw late. Requests for late adds (up until the last day of classes) must be made by the student in the School of Art office (or the office of the department offering the course), and generally are only approved in the case of a documented university error (such as a problem with financial aid being processed), LATE ADD fee will apply. Requests for non-selective withdrawals and retroactive adds (adds after the last day of classes) must be approved by the academic dean of the college in which the student‚Äôs major is located. For AVT majors, that is the CVPA Office of Academic Affairs in College Hall.</p>
